This is a simple 2-player ping pong game. This was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript and NodeJS. The backend server programming was done using socket io. The current version works for localhost at port 8080. To run the game, run node gameServer.js. Then, go to your favourite web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/
